                <p>
                    As you know there is a lot of material to learn and review for the test and you might think the more you study the better you will do. We have important news for you - this is not necessarily true.
                </p>
                <h3>MORE &ne; BETTER</h3>
                <p>
                    Think about the athlete who is training for the Olympics. As the date gets closer and closer, does the athlete train harder and harder? No. The athlete must pace himself and build in “down” time, both physically and mentally. For him to perform at his peak, he must be well rested and focused.
                    This is important for you too.
                </p>
                <h3>THE 90 / 20 RULE</h3>
                <p>
                    Your brain can only focus for about 90 minutes at a time. Afterwards, you need a 20 minute break to renew your energy before you refocus on studying.

                <p>
                    It’s important to come to the test refreshed and focused.
                    Sometimes this is difficult as there are so many thoughts running through your mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The night before the test, take 10 minutes (on a timer) and write down every thought 
                        you have – whether related to the test or not. 
                        This will empty your head of “noise” and allow you to relax and fall asleep.
