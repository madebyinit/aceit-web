                <p>
                    As you know there is a lot of material to learn and review for the test and you might think the more you study the better you will do. We have important news for you - this is not necessarily true.
                </p>
                <h3>MORE &ne; BETTER</h3>
                <p>
                    Think about the athlete who is training for the Olympics. As the date gets closer and closer, does the athlete train harder and harder? No. The athlete must pace himself and build in “down” time, both physically and mentally. For him to perform at his peak, he must be well rested and focused.
                    This is important for you too.
                </p>
                <h3>THE 90 / 20 RULE</h3>
                <p>
                    Your brain can only focus for about 90 minutes at a time. Afterwards, you need a 20 minute break to renew your energy before you refocus on studying.

                <h1>Aceit Dots</h1>
                <p>
                    This ACEIT dot is based on the temperature in your hands. When you get stressed, the tiny blood vessels under the surface of your skin close down and the temperature drops. So when you are very stressed, your hands get cold and the ACEIT dot registers black.
                    <strong>(Keep in mind that in cold weather or with air conditioning, the ACEIT dot will register black).</strong>

                    <div class="metric">Not Stressed Enough</div>
                </div>
                <p>Keep the ACEIT dot on when you are studying and see what color it shows when you are really focused. That is your “zone” which you need to be in to reach your peak performance. When the color moves out of your zone to a different color, use your tools and your routine to get back into your zone. Or maybe it’s time to take a break. See what color registers when you are relaxed.</p>
                <p>You can reattach the ACEIT dot to the card at any time. If you lose your ACEIT dot (as most people do), you can use the ACEIT square instead. Hold your thumb on the square for 10 seconds and see what color shows.</p>
                <p>It is important to use the ACEIT dot or square when you take practice tests so you can become aware of when you are not in your zone. Then you must use your routine in order to once again reach your peak performance.</p>
                <p>Everyone is different and you have to find what works  for you.</p>

                <p>
                    It is very important to get enough sleep especially while studying for the test. If you are sleep deprived, you cannot focus your attention optimally nor learn efficiently. While you sleep your brain is working to consolidate memory – you are learning while you sleep! Your brain is understanding how things fit together and how to summarize the data you’ve studied.
